# particledist

This is a package that uses deep learning to analyze event mass distributions and find new particles. Once you follow the installation instructions below, you can use the boilerplate code provided to replicate our analysis. You can also change some of the hyperparameters to investigate how the model optimizes.

**Installation Instructions**

Provided you have the normal canon of data analysis and machine learning tools installed (`numpy`, `scipy`, `tensorflow 1`, etc.), you should be able to run 


More details on the exact technique used can be found in our NeurIPS submission paper, but below is a quick summary:

A specified number of CMS Open Data simulation jets are loaded (in the boilerplate
